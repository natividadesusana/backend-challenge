Commands to run:

1. Create a Docker image:

        docker build -t backend .

2. Start the services defined in the "docker-compose.yml" file in Docker containers.

        docker-compose up

If you want to see the database through pgadmin, you can log in to **http://localhost:8081**, using the Email: **example@example.com** and Password: **123** (this data is contained in the docker compose file).

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to run the project

1. Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/natividadesusana/backend-challenge.git

2. Install PostgreSQL database:

    [Download and Install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

3. Install the dependencies:

        npm install

4. Generate and apply migrations to the project:

        npx prisma migrate dev

5. To confirm again, generate PrismaClient:

        npx prisma generate

6. You will see that the Seed seed data file has been generated. This is just some example data to get started with the populated bank. If you need to populate the bank again at another time, run the command:

       npx prisma db seed

8. Run the development server:

       npm run dev

9. Access the application on your local machine via the console message:

       Server ready at http://localhost:3000/

10. Go to the **"Query your server"** link mentioned in the console message.

11.  In the "Operation" section, paste the Query below:

          query SuitablePlanets {
            suitablePlanets {
